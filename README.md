# Rock Paper Scissors

* Currently functional in console. 
* Played as round of 5 entering game() in console and using prompts for player choice
* Will output results into console immediately
* Will output results onto page after last prompt completed. 
    * Currently do not know how to work around prompt priority to output page changes as they happen
    * May be tied into loop. Calling function and printing without loop would likely resolve print order but would be less DRY.
