# Rock Paper Scissors

## How to play
* Game begins automatically on page load
* Make selections with rock, paper, and scissors buttons
* Result of round and and score will be updated automatically
* First to 5 points wins
* Use reset button or reload page to play again

## Thoughts
* Functional on page using event listeners. 
* Core logic functional
    * Linear propagation using page to maintain state was easy to implement and appears to be the most common method for page logic. 
        * Still need to improve understanding of when to pass arguments vs let functions recalculate them for DOM changes
    * Will benefit from further learning on best practices for logic implementation in JS
